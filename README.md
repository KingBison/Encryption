# Encryption
Allows a user to create encryption keys and encrypt/decrypt short messages

This program is pretty self explanatory. The left side is used to encrypt/decrypt messages and the right side is used to create new keys. Once the create key button is pressed, a new file will be created with the key. Which will later be called by the encryption and decryption methods.
